        <article>
        I was working away at my gardening round during the week when I decided to use a different method to control the long
        grass growing around the orchard trees and this reminded me of some fundamental rules of gardening that I thought I
        would share with you. <p></p>
        So: <p></p>
        <h3> 1) Bare soil is death <p></p>
        2) If in doubt, do nothing <p></p>
        3) One hour's observation is worth ten hours work <p></p>
        4) There is no such thing as waste, only an unused resource. </h3><p></p>
        So there you have it, employ these guidelines and your garden will be crowned with success. <br>
        See you next week for another blog post. <br>
        Only kidding, but nonetheless, it's really this simple. <p></p>
        However for those who wish a deeper pass at this, I'll expand a bit down here. <p></p>
        <h3>1) Bare soil is death. </h3><p></p>
        When I was doing my permaculture course back in 2001, the instructor of the class - in one of the earliest sessions of
        20 sessions - asked the class what we thought was the biggest environmental problem facing the Earth at this time in our
        history. <br>
        To which we as a class posited various fairly obvious options, pollution, climate change, elevated background
        extinction rate and various variations on these overarching topics. After a few minutes of discussion Geoff, the
        instructor, called it to a halt and said, not in so many words: 'you're all wrong, the answer is soil loss'. <br>
        He then
        proceeded to explain that, and it did make immediate sense. His argument, and I came to fully agree, was that (This is
        if I recall properly) that although pollution, high extinction rates, climate change and all the rest were, and are,
        very bad things, they can all be worked on and solved with some effort. <br>  Climate change can be immediately solved by
        closing coal mines and gas fields and moving with great energy to bring in more renewable energy and continuing the
        research to make all forms of renewable energy even more efficient. However, soil loss is a problem that no amount of
        human effort can solve. <br> This is of course due to the phenomenally long time that it takes for the earth's geological
        processes to make soil in the first place. <br>
        When I was researching this I quickly had a check in case against all odds somehow, somewhere, some group had found a
        way to make soil, but of course that hasn’t happened. <br>
        There are various links that come up when you type ‘<i>Can humans make soil?</i>’ into your favourite search engine, but these
        all refer to not making soil, increasing the sum total of tonnes of soil on the Earth, but refer instead to getting
        various mixes of different types of soil that already exist, and blending them in different proportions to provide soils
        that do different things that humans want - soil specially for growing seeds, raising or lowering the pH etc. <br>
        One of my favourite authors, Kim Stanley Robinson went into this in some depth in his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_trilogy"> Mars trilogy. </a><br>
        As Kim describes there, and it applies to Earth as well as Mars, or indeed any planet where humans plan to go in the
        future. <br>
        Soil can only really be made by geological processes. <br>
        In the Mars trilogy, the human engineers, agronomists and ecologists set up a research project where they see if they
        can make soil. <br>
        They create a huge installation with many giant steel incubating vats and they put various amounts of the poor martian
        soil, with microbes brought from Earth, plus organic matter and nematodes and suchlike crawling creatures and let it
        percolate away to see if it can produce useful soil. <br>
        However while it all works to a certain degree, the process is so slow, that it becomes a rather futile exercise. <br>
        Kim notes that given the results from all their huge steel vats at the engineering centre, the best they could hope for
        is to produce 1 centimetre of soil to cover the whole land area of Mars, and that would take a century to produce. <br>
        And please note, although Kim Stanley Robinson is a science fiction writer, I feel he is more than that, I prefer to
        call him an extrapolationist, someone who sees where we’re at now, and works methodically forwards to where he feels we
        will be at at certain future periods of history. <br>
        Thus I feel his scientific predictions are more than just stories, but good indicators of likely future outcomes. <br>
        So back here on Earth, all of that still applies to us, we can’t make soil, or we can’t make soil in a fashion that is
        of a speed that would be of any earthly (literally and metaphorically) any use to us. <br>
        The most fertile soil on Earth is generally thought to be volcanic soils (it’s the youngest, so stills contains its full
        complement of minerals and trace elements) and a workaround solution - you may suggest - is to get some volcanic rock,
        basalt say, and pulverise that into a fine powder, and then you have made some soil, which you could put in a bag, and
        sell to someone gardening on less than quality soil. <br>
        However, you can immediately see that the amount of energy you would need to smash the single concise rock into a powder
        is so massive, and would take so long, that once again we are behind the energy equation, and the “making” of soil in
        this way is a futile exercise. <br>
        And that ties the whole thing up fairly neatly to the original point, which is that bare soil is death, soil loss is a
        big problem, perhaps the biggest that humans face in the 21st century. <br>
        So whether you have a window box on the window sill of your kitchen containing three herb plants, or you're a broad acre
        farmer with 5,000 hectares in a rural area, cover your soil! <br>
        Not only does this reduce soil loss via runoff into the waterways, it provides you with immediate benefits of stopping
        evaporation, and protecting your plant roots from harsh baking summer sun and freezing, biting winter frosts. <br>
        <p></p>
        
        <h3>2) If in doubt, do nothing/One hour’s observation is worth ten hours work.</h3> <br>

        <figure>
          <img src="/Users/fakename/Sites/blog/images/Tradescantia_fluminens.jpg" alt="">
          <figcaption>Tradescantia fluminens</figcaption>
        </figure>

        
        These two rules go well together, and are a pair of rules that most people latch onto with immediate glee, as it seems
        to be an excuse to do nothing in the garden, at least in the beginning. <br>
        Excuse or not, they are still valuable weapons in your armoury. <br>
        The example my permaculture teacher gave was to do with weeds. <br>
        People would work successfully in the city for many years in a high-paying job, and with the money piling up, they would
        then buy an acreage property outside Byron Bay. <br>
        Contracts would be exchanged, and finally the day would come when they could drive or fly up, and spend their first
        vacation on the land they had recently bought. <br>
        Almost as soon as there they would notice how overgrown with weeds the area had become, and they’d check the local
        department of agriculture website and learn that almost all the chest-high green growth they could see was “weeds” so
        they would go out and starting with the garden beds around the house, begin pulling the weeds out of the ground. <br>
        However this is almost immediately counter-productive, as for one thing, it just exposes the soil and takes us almost
        immediately back to rule 1) bare soil is death. <br>
        A far better way to tackle the weed “problem” on your land, is to spend the first holiday up there just observing what
        is happening on your land, and making some minor notes. <br>
        One of the observations that is probably first and foremost is what type of weeds are growing where.
        Tradescantia, for instance, grows best in shaded, mostly moist areas. <br>
        
        [NB: tradescantia has a common name that is quite racially derogatory, so I won’t use it, but will just provide a
        picture of this plant instead] <br>
        
        So observe where the tradescantia is growing, and resolve to plant something in that area that has a similar growth
        habit. <br>
        As I recall, basil and tomatoes grow well together, and like the same sort of ground that the tradescantia is growing
        on. <br>
        So instead of pulling the trad out of the ground on your first holiday, leave it there, go down to your local organic
        nursery, buy some good quality tomatoes and basil, then come home, clear a small amount of trad away and plant your
        basil and tomatoes in the small clearing you have created. <br>
        Farmer’s friends are another one. <br>
        <figure>
          <img src="/Users/fakename/Sites/blog/images/farmers-friends.jpg" alt="">
          <figcaption>Farmers friends</figcaption>
        </figure>

        Why this weed is called Farmer’s Friends is a matter for some debate, still. <br>
        One opinion is that the burrs of the Farmer’s Friends are so numerous and stick to your clothing so relentlessly, that a
        farmer walking in an overgrown field quickly becomes covered in the prickles and it looks like the farmer has lots of
        friends clinging to them. <br>
        However what I’ve found is that this weed is ultimately a brilliant aid to the home gardener.
        When you pull it out of the ground, and it comes out very easily, it leaves a small hole perfect for you to plant in, so, like the tradescantia above,
        don’t just pull the plant out of the ground the moment you see it, but instead note where they are growing, find a plant
        that looks similar, then when you’re ready to plant, pull the Farmer’s Friend out of the ground, and with no digging,
        even with a hand trowel, you can put your wanted plant straight into the hole, and the job is done for the morning. <br>
        Furthermore, you don't have to pull all the weeds out of an area, to plant a single plant. <br>With farmers friends particularly, remove one farmers friend, then plant your plant, but leave all the others crowding around, these other plants then provide an excellent wind break, and sun shade, and when your new plant is established, then you can begin clearing the bulk of the farmers friends away. <br>
        Additionally, the other best example for <b>If in doubt do nothing</b>, is pruning trees. <br>
        Never has the <b>If in doubt do nothing and one hour’s observation is worth ten hours’ work</b> ever been more forcefully
        applied. <br>
        A common desire for cutting branches off trees is because it’s blocking the view. <br>
        However before you do this, observe from inside your house, particularly in the hottest part of the day, you may find
        that while the branch blocks the view, it also provides shade. <br>
        So then you can spend a bit of time debating with yourself whether you want the shade or the view.
        And never forget that if it’s a deciduous tree (the leaves fall off in Autumn) then leaving the branch in place is
        almost certainly the way to go. <br>
        The leaves provide shade in summer, and then provide a view in the winter.
        If you can live with having the view for half the year, then you’ll save yourself some work and reduce your summer air
        conditioning bill to boot. <br>
        <p></p>
        
        <h3>4) There is no such thing as waste, only an unused resource. </h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="/Users/fakename/Sites/blog/images/palm-fronds_ground_untidy.jpg" alt="">
          <figcaption>Here the palm fronds are untidy</figcaption>
        </figure>
       
        
        The best example I can give of this is to do with grass clippings. <br>
        Grass clippings on your path are considered unsightly, but collected in the catcher of the mower, and dumped carefully
        around your small carefully planted trees, provides weed retardation and soil cover. <br>
        So in the one movement in your garden you reduce the need for watering and weeding around your trees. <br>
        Palm fronds are another one. <br>
        Up here on the northern rivers, palm fronds drop like bombs for the whole summer, and are considered ugly and messy once
        they hit the ground. <br>
        However, instead of seeing them as a waste product, the best action is to strip the leaves bit of the frond, and use
        that as mulch, and then dispose of the remaining stalk and blade part onto a pile somewhere in your garden. <br>
        <br>

        
        
        
        
        So immediately I hear you ask, ‘well isn’t the stalk and blade bit now waste?’ <br>
        Well, yes and no, what you do is put the pile of now denuded palm fronds in an area where you would like to create a new
        garden in the future. <br>
        The heavy fronds stacked up will kill any grass or weeds underneath, and then when you’re ready to plant in your new
        garden, you pull the fronds way, or if they’re in an advanced stage of decomposition, leave them there, cover them with
        soil, and plant into your new earthen mound. <br>
        And the final note on this topic, and probably the best example, is sawdust. <br>
        Up here where I work, there are many, many, paths liad out around expensive homes that use pebbles. <br>
        Pebbles drive anyone like me who has to run a brush cutter across the area nuts. <br>
        You simply cannot whipper-snip near a pebble path without sooner rather than later, the spinning head of your machine
        picking up pebbles and throwing them around the garden, a danger of smashing windows, chipping car duco, smashing car
        windscreens and all the rest. <br>
        What’s more, you can’t walk on a pebble garden in bare feet, and pebbles are heavy, so making the path in the first
        place is an exercise in hard work. <br>
        A far better alternative for paths is to use sawdust, it’s soft underfoot, and does no damage of the whipper-snipper
        line picks it up and throws it. <br>
        The one problem (now) with sawdust as a path material is that it is quite expensive. <br>
        I was talking about this with a staff member in my local Bunnings store a couple of weeks ago. <br>
        <figure>
          <img src="/Users/fakename/Sites/blog/images/Screenshot 2024-03-16 at 12.13.53 pm.png" alt="">
          <figcaption>Here the palm frond leaves, stripped from the blade and with some grass clippings, provide an excellent grass
            retardation ring around the avocado seedlings.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        There must have been a time when sawdust was a waste product at the sawmill, and the mill may have had a difficult time
        wondering how to get rid of it. <br>
       
        But as time went by, and more and more home owners began to come to the mill and ask to buy some cubic metres of sawdust
        to use as mulch around the home, it would have quickly dawned on the mill’s owners that now sawdust was now a desirable
        product, and indeed a perfect example of rule four: there is no such thing as waste, only an unused resource.  <br>
        
        And closing rule four off I would add, that sawdust is problematic in a few ways in the modern era.
        One, it is unlikely that you would ever cut enough wood at home to provide enough sawdust to provide cover for your
        paths, and then we’re into should we be cutting that many trees down anyway to feed the mill with base product. <br>
        So instead of that, use grass clippings for your path. <br> 
        Grass clippings from the mower are as soft as sawdust, they last a long time, you can walk on the clippings in bare
        feet, and you have an inexhaustible supply from mowing your lawn every two weeks. <br>

          <h4>The sod's law section, and other fillers</h4>
          When I restarted this blog after the gap fighting off homelessness and general stress, I was minorly worried that I would run out of things to write about, however either my life is riven with annoying situations or I'm doing life wrong. <br>
          Indeed one of the things I learned when I set out to be a writer was that if you're doing non-fiction, and trying to be somewhat humorous, as an aauthor you have to have bad experiences, as they make the best stories. <br>
          For instance if you go travelling and your planes and buses are all on time, nothing breaks down in the middle of nowhere, and all your hotel reservations work perfectly and you never have to sleep in the transit lounge of the airport, who wants to read about that??!?
          <br>
          So this morning I decided I needed to ride my second bike across the river to the petrol station to pump the tyres up to their optimal 40psi.
           <br>
          <figure>
            <img src="/Users/fakename/Sites/blog/images/two_bikes.jpeg" alt="">
            <figcaption>My long range, good bike, the mallee bull, is on the right, the let-it-rust banger is on the left.</figcaption>
          </figure>
           I thought long and hard about it, as my second bike is not the right size, and is a bit uncomfortable to ride. <br>
           I bought it because I didn't want to ride my good bike - given to me with much gratitude by Col Stokes - to the beach each day, as that means it rusts up as quick as lightning, and every six months the cables, cassette and chain have to be replace.
            <br>
            So I bought an old banger from the hock shop for $50, and it's been working well as my let-it-rust bike. <br>
            So I headed across the river on the ferrry and sure enough, after doing all that uncomfortable riding, I discovered that the petrol station had had to remove the pump because it was faulty. <br>
            Sigh. <br>
            However things worked out well, turns out my excellent neighbour, Sef, has an electric pump with guage, and upon my return, he came over and pumped up my tyres for me, thank you Sef. <br>
            Which only adds to the sighing in its way, why the fudge didn't I ask around before I cycled all that way?? <br>
            One day I'll learn I spose, but don't bank on it, sixty years have gone by and I haven't woken up yet.

            <h3>Change the name?</h3><br>

            </figure>
            Finally, I have been doing a lot of physiotherapy work on my chronically injured right hip and ankle, to do this I mostly ride the let-it-rust bike down to the river, and do a form of aquarobics in the water, I call it RiveRobics. <br>
            It's great down there, but the problem is it is yet another activity I do alone, and since lonliness is one of my problems these days, I thought maybe I would start going to the gym again, and working out there. <br>
            So I checked the serach engine for gyms in Ballina, and discovered this one, which I would think either has to change its name, or start f***ing opening 24 hours. <br>
