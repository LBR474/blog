        I was musing during the week on a range of topics, wondering what to write about here, and I began thinking
        that…,
        actually, scratch that and let me start again.<br>
        I was FUMING during the week, as usual, thinking of the f**ing range of people that infest my life these days,
        people
        who seem to take pleasure in going out of their way to make the lives of those who they encounter as hard as
        possible,
        and that of course reminded me of something I saw on The Simpsons, a show which has brought enormous pleasure
        into my
        life, and almost always provides a good graphic to highlight the point I’m trying to make.<br>
        Here it’s of course Homer’s revenge list, and that reminded me that it’s time I updated mine.<br>
        So I suppose to start, you may have noticed that the blog is in a new location this week, now that’s because of
        the
        constant crap that the major players on the internet seek to dispense to the ordinary digital citizens like me
        who are
        just trying to do some writing each week, and share it with friends.<br>
        To explain, I started this recent manifestation of the blog on WordPress for a few reasons but one of the main
        ones was
        about finding work in the current phase of my life.<br>
        I like being a gardener, but what I don’t like much is the constant driving I have to do to do my work.<br>
        Most weeks these days I drive 400 kilometres to get around my various clients’ houses and do the mowing, weeding
        and
        brush-cutting.<br>
        So going back a few months, well maybe even a year or so, I thought I would explore going back to computer
        programming.<br>
        That can be very stressful, but it does have the major upside that it can be done at home, indeed with servers
        and
        remote access, the computer programming industry was of course one of the leaders being able to employ people in
        another
        city, another state, and even another country.<br>
        I rang a few digital houses in my local area, and one guy I spoke with here in Ballina, Ben, opined that there
        wasn’t
        much call for my main programming specialties, but most sites he worked up for clients were six to eight page
        websites
        for small businesses, all done in WordPress.<br>
        So I figured I better learn WordPress.<br>
        I was reasonably successful (I feel) at this, however almost every time I learned something about that fat,
        bloated hog
        of a software package, I became correspondingly increasingly disenchanted with it, and it slowly dawned on me
        that I
        didn’t want to spend the rest of my life fiddling about inside the admin panel of WordPress websites, trying to
        solve
        the latest problem that was caused by other people’s code.<br>
        So at around that point I began to give up on the idea of going back to computer programming as a job.<br>
        And that led, in a roundabout way, to me musing on what I really wanted to do in life, and thus, and thankfully,
        I
        recalled that I always wanted to be a writer.<br>
        So I thought I would start the blog again, and get back in practice.<br>
        However, as a compromise, I thought I would do the blog on a WordPress free site, and at least keep my hand in
        with
        WordPress programming.<br>
        So I wrote two posts there, but by the time I’d done the second one, I began to notice that there was a
        formatting bug
        in the WordPress code.<br>
        <div class="floatLeft">
          <figure>
            <img src="images/WordPress_formatting_bug.png" alt="The WordPress formatting bug">
            <figcaption>The WordPress formatting bug</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
        The figure on the left here shows the problem.<br> The paragraphs in green are correctly formatted, while the
        ones in red
        show that by this stage I’d already lost patience with it, and just published them as they were.<br>
        I write these posts in journalistic style, which means every sentence is its own paragraph.<br>
        So when you hit a full stop, you hit enter, and a new paragraph is automatically started for you.<br>
        However with WordPress this wasn't the case, what you had to do was go to the end of the paragraph, hit the
        space bar,
        then hit the enter button, and then WordPress would add two lines, instead of the correct only one line.<br>
        So I hit the delete on the second line, and that just sent the whole thing back to there being no new line at
        all.<br>
        So fuming at that, I worked on it and discovered that the solution was even more finicky and blood-pressure
        raising than
        I would have believed possible.<br>
        You had to do all of the above, then cursor down to the start of the new paragraph, then make sure your cursor
        symbol
        was hard up against the left margin, then hit delete from there.<br>
        This solved the problem, but then I realised as mentioned above, I would have to write the whole post, and then
        go down
        and make all these finicky and enraging changes for each paragraph.<br>
        And that’s when I said: ‘fuck this’ and WordPress made the list.<br>
        So then I decided to go back and check my old blog site, where I can remember never having this enraging
        problem, and
        see if I could start using that site again and write stuff without having my blood pressure raised to levels
        that would
        make a heart surgeon gibber.<br>
        However once I got over there, I discovered a new problem that was in its way, even worse.<br>
        Turns out that you need some sort of privacy policy to explain to your readers what data you are collecting on
        them, or more enragingly accurately, what data Google and WordPress are collecting from your blog.<br>
        The moment I read that it immediately occurred to me that since both Blogger and WordPress registered page
        views, that
        meant they were collecting some form of data, so with yet another lugubrious sigh I realised I was going to have
        to do
        some research and write, or get a privacy policy.<br>
        Now needless to say, once I began looking into a privacy policy, it quickly became evident, that this was no
        easy task.<br>
        There are some free privacy policy generator sites on the web, but when I went there, thinking that should make
        it easy
        but discovered that these sites ask a series of questions that I had no idea of the answers to, and so with,
        once again,
        my blood pressure rising to nuclear overload levels, I decided that I’m not gonna do that either.<br>
        Since I didn’t really know what data Google, who now own the Blogspot website, or WordPress were collecting, I
        couldn’t
        fill out the questions, since I had no real idea of the answers, and, as ever with these bloody things, most of
        the info
        I’d garnered from the web indicated that having a privacy policy that was wrong, or at least incomplete, was as
        legally
        problematic as not having one at all, I gave up on the whole idea decided to do my own blog at my GitHub
        repository.<br>
        Here I can control what does, and doesn’t, go on the page, and thus has a measure of peace of mind about you,
        the reader
        visiting the site.<br>
        So here is the privacy policy, the blog is now just a simple HTML page that you can read.<br>
        There are no ‘subscribe’, ‘like’ or comments section, and I certainly am not collecting any data at all.<br>
        So you can just go on the site, read it, hopefully enjoy it, and then leave.<br>
        If you wish to comment, you can do so back at Facebook which is the only place I share the new blog site on
        social
        media.<br>
        So there we have it, that's why WordPress are now on my list.
        <br>
        I won't share the full list with you, because as you would suspect from my eternal complaining, the list is now
        so long that I need a whole server, not just a single page, to write it fully.

        Also during the week, I ran into some old friends from Byron, Barb and Ivan, we had a good chat, and during that
        Ivo (I
        think), came up with a Wildean doublet, that seemed pretty funny at the time <br>
        The topic was divorce and marriage, and tho I can’t remember how the topic came up, we laughed together over the
        end
        summary of it, which was: <br>
        ‘The only thing worse than getting divorced is getting married in the first place’. <br>
        So there’s a philosophy for life than we can all muse on. <br>
        And quick PS: I'm not referring here to my ex-wife, she deserved better than me as a young man, arrogant,
        uncaring, selfish and entitled young shit that I was. <br>
        And of course, the final word on Wildean doublets is (almost inevitably) Monty Python. <br>
        There is a famous sketch where the accepted wits and thinkers of the day are gathered around the king and are engaged in constant flattery of the royal. <br>
        However the wits get involved in a round of trying to get the others in trouble, and so end up making increasingly derogatory remarks about the king, and so..., well anyway, rather than me try to explain it, 
         you can find that sketch here:
